# Essexrambler2.github.io
This was built with a friend who completed WDI23 at General Assembly too, we decided to use this rather than a template portfolio page, as it allowed more freedom to learn some new material too. Its quite a nice build process and the Columns allows for more content to be added in the future.
Played around with the styling and tried to add more up to date CSS techniques and maybe some parallax scrolling at some point too, but happy with the end result and hope you enjoy viewing, contact me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a future project.
